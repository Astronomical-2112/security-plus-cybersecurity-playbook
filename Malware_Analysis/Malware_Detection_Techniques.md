 - Automation
 
 Automating security is a very difficult task that requiers a lot of consideration.
 It requiers a lot of support and resources that are needed for managing the software, as well as it being a single point of failure if it is relied on too much.
 That being said, having an automatic detection system is very important.  
 Having to gather information what happened manually is quite tedious, and requires a lot of manpower at a certain scale.
 Automated systems can help isolate any threats before it is too late.
 
 - Orchestration
 
Orchestras are groups of security professionals that all work together to keep an eye out for any strange or odd behavior.
Each person only has to worry about a few tasks, and because of that they are all able to work together to find any issues arising at any given time.
However, by their nature orchestras are a reactive force, they can not prevent any issues, only solve any issue that is currently occuring.

 - Threat Hunting 
 
 Threat hunting is a proactive step in trying to prevent issues, they work from the assumption that there is always some type of attack occuring.
 Threat hunters are constantly looking for evidence that an issue has occured.  Rather than acting when there appears to be an issue, they are constantly trying to find where one might be lurking.
 Unlike penetration testers, who are also proactive, they are not trying to test if a threat actor could do something and how to solve it.
 Instead they are just looking for any issues that are currently present in the network.
