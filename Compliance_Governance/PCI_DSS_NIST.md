Compliance frameworks are industry wide guidelines and laws established to protect consumers and competition.
PCI DSS is a standard for how companies are supposed to handle payment card information.
The standards were created as a way to protect consumer card data and to unify the disparate standards each payment processor had.
The NIST is a governing body that outlines all sorts of technological standards.
NIST guidelines have a strong focus on security, all companies within the US must comply with NIST security standards.
Requirements include limiting access as much as possible, also known as the principle of least privlige; constant auditing, to make sure that everything is secure; 
contingency planning for when attacks do happen; and much more than that.
The goal of compliance frameworks in cybersecurity is to protect end user data, and to make sure that the end user feels like they can trust the company.
