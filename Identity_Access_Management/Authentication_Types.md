 - MFA

Multi-Factor Authentication is a security measure that requires the user to input more than just a username and a password.
The idea is that a hacker would need more than just a password in order to gain unauthorized access.
MFA usually asks for the user to input a code sent via email or a text message, but many other methods exist.
The most common type of MFA is called Two-Factor Authentication, where only two methods are used, but you can use more than just two with MFA.

 - Biometrics

Biometric authentication requires the use of biological characteristics to authenticate a user.
The most common are thumbprint and face scanners, but everything from retnal scans to DNA scanning are also sometimes used.
Biometrics work off of the principle that a legitimate user has unique biological charecteristics that an attacker doesn't share.

 - Token

Security tokens are physical devices that limit access by requiring possession.
The most common example is a keycard, though how that keycard works can very depending on how the underlying system works.
Some cards are completly wireless relying on wifi or bluetooth to communicate.
